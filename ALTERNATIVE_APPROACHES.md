# Alternative TDX Attestation Approaches

This document provides detailed information about alternative approaches to TDX attestation when Intel Trust Authority API is not available.

## Overview

Intel Trust Authority API may not be publicly available or accessible to all users. This toolkit provides several alternative approaches that work without external API dependencies.

## Available Alternatives

### 1. Local Attestation (`tdx-local-attestation.sh`)

**Purpose**: Performs TDX attestation using local system analysis without requiring Trust Authority API.

**Features**:
- ✅ Works without external API dependencies
- ✅ Uses local system analysis for TDX verification
- ✅ Generates local evidence and mock quotes
- ✅ Perfect for testing and development
- ✅ No internet connectivity required

**Usage**:
```bash
sudo ./tdx-local-attestation.sh
```

**Output Files**:
- `tdx-local-evidence.json` - Local TDX evidence
- `tdx-local-quote.bin` - Mock TDX quote
- `tdx-measurements.json` - System measurements
- `tdx-local-attestation-report.json` - Comprehensive report

### 2. System Analyzer (`tdx-system-analyzer.sh`)

**Purpose**: Performs deep analysis of TDX capabilities and system readiness.

**Features**:
- ✅ Comprehensive TDX system analysis
- ✅ CPU, memory, and kernel module analysis
- ✅ Security feature assessment
- ✅ TDX readiness evaluation
- ✅ Detailed recommendations

**Usage**:
```bash
./tdx-system-analyzer.sh
```

**Output Files**:
- `tdx-system-analysis.json` - Detailed system analysis report

### 3. Mock Attestation (`tdx-mock-attestation.sh`)

**Purpose**: Creates complete mock attestation environment for testing and development.

**Features**:
- ✅ Generates realistic mock TDX evidence
- ✅ Creates mock attestation tokens
- ✅ Produces mock TDX quotes
- ✅ Perfect for testing attestation verification logic
- ✅ No real cryptographic operations

**Usage**:
```bash
./tdx-mock-attestation.sh
```

**Output Files**:
- `tdx-mock-evidence.json` - Mock TDX evidence
- `tdx-mock-token.json` - Mock attestation token
- `tdx-mock-quote.bin` - Mock TDX quote
- `tdx-mock-attestation-report.json` - Mock attestation report

### 4. Local Quote Generator (`tdx-quote-generator.sh`)

**Purpose**: Generates TDX quotes using local system tools.

**Features**:
- ✅ Extracts TDX system information
- ✅ Generates local quote data
- ✅ Works without external dependencies
- ✅ Provides detailed system status

**Usage**:
```bash
sudo ./tdx-quote-generator.sh
```

**Output Files**:
- `tdx-quote-info.json` - TDX quote information
- `tdx-quote.bin` - Binary TDX quote (if available)

| Real TDX Evidence | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Local Only | ❌ No | ❌ Mock Only |
| Production Ready | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Testing Only | ❌ Analysis Only | ❌ Testing Only |
| Internet Required | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Root Access Required | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Mock Data Generation | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| System Analysis | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Yes | ✅ Comprehensive | ❌ No |

## Use Cases

### Development and Testing
- **Mock Attestation**: Use for testing attestation verification logic
- **Local Attestation**: Use for testing TDX system integration
- **System Analyzer**: Use for understanding TDX capabilities

### Research and Education
- **System Analyzer**: Use for learning about TDX system requirements
- **Local Attestation**: Use for understanding TDX attestation process
- **Mock Attestation**: Use for educational demonstrations

### Integration Testing
- **Mock Attestation**: Use for testing your application's attestation handling
- **Local Attestation**: Use for testing TDX system integration
- **Quote Generator**: Use for testing quote parsing and analysis

## Limitations

### Local Attestation
- ⚠️ Evidence is not cryptographically verified by Intel
- ⚠️ Not suitable for production security requirements
- ⚠️ Limited to local system analysis

### Mock Attestation
- ⚠️ All data is generated for demonstration purposes
- ⚠️ No real cryptographic operations
- ⚠️ Not suitable for production use

### System Analyzer
- ⚠️ Analysis only, no attestation generation
- ⚠️ No cryptographic verification

## Recommendations

### For Testing and Development
1. Start with `tdx-system-analyzer.sh` to understand your system's TDX capabilities
2. Use `tdx-mock-attestation.sh` to generate test data for your applications
3. Use `tdx-local-attestation.sh` for local TDX testing

### For Production Use
1. Apply for Intel Trust Authority API access
2. Use the main `tdx-attestation.sh` script with real API credentials
3. Consider the limitations of local attestation approaches

### For Research and Education
1. Use `tdx-system-analyzer.sh` to understand TDX system requirements
2. Use `tdx-mock-attestation.sh` for educational demonstrations
3. Study the generated reports to understand TDX attestation structure

## Getting Started

### Quick Test (No API Required)
```bash
# 1. Analyze your system
./tdx-system-analyzer.sh

# 2. Generate mock data for testing
./tdx-mock-attestation.sh

# 3. Run local attestation
sudo ./tdx-local-attestation.sh

# 4. Verify all results
./tdx-verifier.sh --all
```

### For Application Testing
```bash
# 1. Generate mock attestation data
./tdx-mock-attestation.sh

# 2. Use the generated files to test your application:
#    - tdx-mock-evidence.json
#    - tdx-mock-token.json
#    - tdx-mock-quote.bin
```

## Security Considerations

- **Mock Data**: Never use mock data in production environments
- **Local Evidence**: Local evidence is not cryptographically verified
- **API Keys**: If you do get Trust Authority API access, store keys securely
- **Logs**: Review log files for sensitive information before sharing

## Support

For questions about alternative approaches:
1. Check the script documentation and comments
2. Review the generated reports for detailed information
3. Use the system analyzer to understand your specific environment
4. Consider applying for Intel Trust Authority API access for production use
